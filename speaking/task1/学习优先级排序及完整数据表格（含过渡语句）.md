| 教育与学习 | Your university requires that you take a history course, and you have two options that fit your schedule. The first course is taught by a professor who is well-known for giving engaging lectures and includes class discussions. The second course is led by a professor who rarely lectures and instead encourages students to participate in discussions actively. Which course would you choose to fulfill your history requirement? Explain why. | 选择偏好型 | I would choose the course led by the professor who encourages active participation. Firstly, this teaching style allows students to engage deeply with the material, promoting critical thinking and better retention of information. For example, active discussions can help me learn from different perspectives and improve my communication skills. Although engaging lectures are beneficial, I believe that active involvement in class discussions will provide a more enriching learning experience. Therefore, the course that encourages discussions is more advantageous. | 1 |
| 教育与学习 | Some people believe that young people spend excessive time on electronic devices and should try to use them less. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion, and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I agree that young people spend excessive time on electronic devices and should use them less. Firstly, prolonged screen time can lead to health issues such as eye strain and poor posture. Additionally, it can negatively affect social skills and face-to-face interactions. For instance, I have noticed that spending too much time on my phone reduces the time I spend with family and friends. Therefore, reducing screen time can improve physical health and foster better relationships. | 2 |
| 教育与学习 | Some people prefer to read reviews written by critics before watching a movie. Other people prefer to watch the movie without reading reviews. Which way do you prefer and why? | 选择偏好型 | I prefer to read reviews written by critics before watching a movie. Firstly, reviews can provide valuable insights about the plot, acting, and overall quality, helping me decide if the movie is worth my time and money. For example, I recently read reviews before watching a new release, and the positive feedback assured me it would be enjoyable. While some people enjoy the surprise of an uninformed viewing, I find that reviews enhance my movie-watching experience. Therefore, reading reviews is beneficial. | 3 |
| 教育与学习 | Happiness comes from helping others rather than helping yourself. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion, and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I agree that happiness comes from helping others rather than helping yourself. Firstly, acts of kindness and generosity create a sense of fulfillment and purpose. For example, volunteering at a local shelter made me feel connected to my community and gave me immense satisfaction. Additionally, helping others not only benefits them but also enhances our own well-being by fostering a sense of connection and gratitude. While self-care is important, altruism brings deeper, long-lasting happiness. Therefore, helping others is more fulfilling. | 4 |
| 教育与学习 | Some people believe that students should be required to learn at least one foreign language in school. Others think that learning a foreign language should be optional. Which view do you agree with and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I believe that students should be required to learn at least one foreign language in school. Firstly, learning a foreign language enhances cognitive abilities, improves cultural understanding, and increases future career opportunities. For example, knowing a second language can make travel more enjoyable and open up job prospects in international companies. While optional language learning can reduce pressure on students, the benefits of bilingualism are too significant to be ignored. Therefore, mandatory language learning is essential. | 5 |
| 教育与学习 | Some people think that reading the news every day is important to stay informed about current events. Others think it is not necessary to follow the news daily. Which view do you agree with and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I agree that reading the news every day is important to stay informed about current events. Firstly, staying updated with the news helps us understand what is happening around the world and make informed decisions. For instance, knowing about local and global issues allows us to participate in meaningful discussions and act responsibly. While it can be overwhelming at times, being well-informed is crucial for active citizenship. Therefore, reading the news daily is beneficial. | 6 |
| 教育与学习 | Your university is planning to invite some guest speakers to give lectures to students. Some students think that the university should not invite guest speakers who have controversial opinions. Other students think that the university should invite various guest speakers, regardless of their opinions. Which point of view do you support and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I support inviting various guest speakers, regardless of their opinions. Firstly, exposure to different viewpoints encourages critical thinking and open-mindedness. For example, listening to diverse perspectives can help students form well-rounded opinions and understand complex issues. While controversial opinions may be challenging, they stimulate important discussions and debates, enhancing the educational experience. Therefore, it's important to foster an environment where diverse ideas are heard and analyzed. | 7 |
| 教育与学习 | Because most students have their own laptops, your university is considering closing the campus computer lab, where students use university-owned computers. Do you think this is a good idea and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I don't think closing the campus computer lab is a good idea. Firstly, while many students have laptops, the computer lab provides essential resources for those who do not. Additionally, it offers specialized software and equipment that may not be available on personal devices. For example, graphic design students may rely on high-end computers for their projects. Therefore, maintaining the computer lab ensures that all students have equal access to necessary technology and resources. | 8 |
| 教育与学习 | Some people believe the most important quality of a leader is being a gifted speaker. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion? Why? | 同意/不同意型 | I agree that being a gifted speaker is one of the most important qualities of a leader. Firstly, effective communication helps leaders to inspire and motivate their team, clearly convey their vision, and persuade others to follow their lead. For example, Martin Luther King Jr.'s powerful speeches were instrumental in advancing the civil rights movement. While other qualities like integrity and decisiveness are important, the ability to communicate effectively is crucial for leadership. Therefore, being a gifted speaker is essential. | 9 |
| 教育与学习 | Nowadays, more robots are performing work traditionally done by humans. Do you think this is a positive trend? Explain why or why not, using examples and details. | 同意/不同意型 | I think the increasing use of robots is a positive trend. Firstly, robots can perform repetitive and dangerous tasks more efficiently and safely than humans. For example, robots in manufacturing can assemble products with precision, reducing errors and increasing productivity. Additionally, automation can free up human workers to focus on more creative and complex tasks, leading to innovation and economic growth. While there are concerns about job displacement, the overall benefits of increased efficiency and safety are significant. Therefore, the use of robots is beneficial. | 10 |
| 教育与学习 | People's social skills have declined as their use of technology has increased. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion, and why? | 同意/不同意型 | I agree that people's social skills have declined as their use of technology has increased. Firstly, over-reliance on digital communication can reduce face-to-face interactions and weaken interpersonal skills. For example, people might prefer texting over having a conversation, leading to misunderstandings and a lack of genuine connection. While technology offers convenience, balancing it with in-person interactions is crucial for maintaining strong social skills. Therefore, the decline in social skills due to technology is concerning. | 11 |
| 教育与学习 | Your city is considering a proposal to require car owners to pay an additional fee if they drive cars that do not meet environmental standards set by the city for air pollution. Do you think this is a good idea? Explain why or why not. | 同意/不同意型 | I think this is a good idea. Firstly, requiring car owners to pay an additional fee for driving vehicles that do not meet environmental standards can incentivize people to switch to greener alternatives. For example, it can encourage the use of electric cars or public transportation, leading to reduced air pollution and improved public health. While it may be an inconvenience for some car owners, the long-term environmental benefits justify the proposal. Therefore, the proposal is beneficial. | 12 |
| 教育与学习 | When teaching children proper behavior, some parents think it is more effective to offer rewards when children behave well. Other parents think it is more effective to discipline their children when they misbehave. Which point of view do you agree with? | 同意/不同意型 | I believe that offering rewards when children behave well is more effective. Firstly, positive reinforcement encourages children to repeat good behavior and fosters a positive parent-child relationship. For example, praising a child for completing their homework on time can motivate them to continue doing so. While discipline is necessary in certain situations, consistently rewarding good behavior promotes a more constructive and supportive learning environment. Therefore, offering rewards is more effective. | 13 |
| 工作与职业 | Some people prefer to work in a company where they have the independence to complete tasks and offer solutions to problems on their own. Others prefer to work in an environment where they are told exactly what to do. Which work situation do you prefer? Explain why. | 选择偏好型 | I prefer to work in a company where I have the independence to complete tasks and offer solutions. Firstly, this autonomy allows me to be creative and innovative in my approach to problems. Additionally, it helps me develop my decision-making skills and boosts my confidence. For example, being able to work independently makes the job more fulfilling and prepares me for leadership roles in the future. While guidance is important, the freedom to make decisions is crucial for professional growth. Therefore, working independently is more beneficial. | 14 |
| 工作与职业 | Some people prefer to have a job or profession that will allow them to work on a variety of different tasks each day. Others prefer having jobs with routine, predictable tasks that they work on every day. Which type of job would you prefer and why? | 选择偏好型 | I prefer a job that allows me to work on a variety of different tasks each day. Firstly, this variety keeps the work interesting and prevents boredom. Additionally, it provides opportunities to develop a wide range of skills and adapt to new challenges. For example, in my previous job, I enjoyed working on different projects because it kept me engaged and motivated. While routine tasks can provide stability, I find that variety leads to personal and professional growth. Therefore, a job with varied tasks is more advantageous. | 15 |
| 工作与职业 | Some people prefer to work in a team. Others prefer to work independently. Which do you prefer and why? | 选择偏好型 | I prefer to work in a team because collaboration brings diverse perspectives and ideas, leading to more innovative solutions. Additionally, working with others enhances my communication and teamwork skills. For example, in my previous job, team projects often resulted in better outcomes because we could combine our strengths and support each other. While working independently has its benefits, teamwork fosters creativity and ensures a well-rounded approach to problem-solving. Therefore, working in a team is more beneficial. | 16 |
| 工作与职业 | Imagine you have been offered two jobs in the same field with similar salaries and benefits. One is with a large, well-established company with a good reputation. The other is with a small start-up company that has just begun. Which job would you choose, and why? | 选择偏好型 | I would choose the job with the large, well-established company with a good reputation. Firstly, a well-established company offers more stability, structured career development, and extensive resources. For example, they are likely to have well-defined training programs and opportunities for advancement. While a start-up may offer more flexibility and innovation, the stability and professional growth opportunities in a large company are more appealing to me at this stage of my career. Therefore, the large company is a better choice. | 17 |
| 工作与职业 | Some people think that news stories about the personal lives of famous actors and musicians are not worth reporting as news. Other people think such stories help these people become more real and relatable. Do you think these news stories are beneficial or not? Explain why. | 同意/不同意型 | I think news stories about the personal lives of famous actors and musicians are not worth reporting as news. Firstly, these stories often distract from more important issues and contribute to the invasion of privacy. For example, focusing on celebrities' personal lives can overshadow critical news about political or environmental matters. While some argue that it makes celebrities more relatable, I believe that news should prioritize information that has a significant impact on society. Therefore, such stories are not beneficial. | 18 |
| 工作与职业 | Some people believe that the most important quality of a leader is being a gifted speaker. Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?

What kind of film do you prefer and why? | 选择偏好型 | I prefer to watch movies that make me think and carry important societal messages. Firstly, these films not only entertain me but also broaden my understanding of different issues. For example, watching documentaries about climate change has deepened my awareness of environmental problems and inspired me to adopt eco-friendly habits. While entertaining movies are enjoyable, thought-provoking films provide valuable insights and can inspire positive change in society. Therefore, I prefer thought-provoking films. | 20 |
| 社会与文化 | Some people enjoy giving gifts, while others enjoy receiving them. Which do you prefer? Explain why, using details and examples. | 选择偏好型 | I prefer giving gifts because it brings me joy to make others happy.

For instance, last year, I gave my best friend a personalized photo album, and her reaction was priceless. Additionally, giving gifts allows me to express my love and appreciation for the people in my life. While receiving gifts is nice, the happiness of giving is more rewarding.

While simply looking at exhibits is also enjoyable, photography enhances my museum experience. Therefore, I prefer museums that allow photography. | 22 |

Firstly, being aware of international news helps us understand different cultures, economies, and political situations. For example, knowing about global health issues like the COVID-19 pandemic enables us to take necessary precautions and make informed decisions. Staying informed fosters a sense of global citizenship and promotes empathy and awareness of worldwide issues. Therefore, reading the news daily is beneficial. | 23 |

While it's important to consider health limitations, taking reasonable risks can lead to fulfilling and enriching experiences for older adults. Therefore, trying new things is beneficial for the elderly. | 25 |
| 生活与健康 | Some people prefer to be constantly busy and always have something to do. Others prefer to spend some of their time being relaxed and sometimes feel like doing nothing. Which do you think is better? Explain why. | 选择偏好型 | I believe it is better to have a balance between being busy and having time to relax. Firstly, constant busyness can lead to burnout and stress, while regular relaxation can improve mental health and overall well-being.

A balanced approach ensures that we maintain our physical and mental health while achieving our goals. Therefore, balance is key. | 26 |

Firstly, a peaceful environment is essential for my well-being and productivity. For example, living in a quiet area allows me to concentrate better on my work and enjoy a tranquil lifestyle. While convenience is important, the benefits of a quiet and calm environment outweigh the advantages of living close to amenities. Therefore, the quiet place is preferable. | 27 |
